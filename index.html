          <p class="lead">One thing you absolutely have to bring to the birth center is a car seat, and while all infant car seats look very similar, the most convenient would be the one which comes with a travel system. It will include a base which you install in the back seat of your car, a car seat itself and a carrier which the car seat clicks in to. This allow to move your baby in and out of the car without having to wake her up! Absolute must have. The one I chose â Chicco Bravo â also transforms into a regular stroller which will carry your baby from ~6 month (thatâs when they start sitting up) through toddler years. Good to know: you can purchase multiple car bases if you use more than one car. </p>
          <p class="lead"><span class="font-weight-bold">Chicco Bravo Trio Travel System:</span> $<span class="price">379.99</span>, Amazon.com</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Alternative: <span class="text-muted">bassinet included</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">One downside of Chicco Bravo Travel System is that it doesnât come with a bassinet, which means that if you want to take your baby on a walk, sheâll have to stay in a somewhat upright position strapped to the seat for the whole time. Bassinet, on the opposite side, provides the comfort of the crib and your baby will lay down in it perfectly flat. I personally didnât enjoy long walks for the first half a year of my babyâs life, so for my needs â such as shopping trips â Chicco Bravo worked just fine. My friend, however, spent hours pushing the stroller at the nearest waterfront park. Well, she was lucky to live near one, and then again thatâs how her baby prefferd to sleep. Her family chose to invest into a more functional, more solid and definitely fancier option. The model offers a car seat, a bassinet and a carrier which will work with both of them.</p>

A diaper backpack will also come with a changing pad and insulated bottle pockets â nice! Not to mention tons of pockets to keep you organized. And there are all kinds of designs for you to choose from. My husband and I decided on a neutral gray one so we both feel good about wearing it.</p>

          <p class="lead">Regardless of what time of the year weâre talking about, itâs a good idea to have a medium warmth blanket handy, even during summer. Because, you know, air conditioners. A blanket is an easy way to add an extra layer to your babyâs outfit, and itâs actually the only safe way to keep your baby warm in a car in colder months. Safety guidelines forbid parents from bundling up little ones in winter coats and parkas when putting them in a car seat, because the straps wonât tighten well enough. You dress the baby into a fleece suit, strap her into the seat and then tuck a blanket on top of it. My family ended up getting a blanket for every car, stroller and place where baby has to spend time at. We had at least five, if not more!</p>
          <p class="lead">The very important piece here â you canât leave a baby with a blanket unsupervised because of a suffocation risk. That means that youâre either constantly keeping an eye on him or swaddle/tuck the blanket into the car seat nice and snug.</p>

          <p class="lead">With baby clothes, there are three questions that every parent-to-be is struggling with.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First, what size?</li>
            <li>Second, what items?</li>
            <li>And third, how many?</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead">Letâs start with sizes. With an infant you have a choice of three sizes â Preemie, Newborn and 0-3 months. Preemie is tiny, so unless you know for a fact that youâre having a very small baby, no need to consider it. Usually the first size in clothes for most babies is Newborn. Baby sizes are based on both weight and height. Per Carterâs size table, Newborn fits babies with 6-9 lbs. weight and 17- 21.5" height, and thatâs not a particularly big baby either. My baby was born 7 lbs. and 20 inches, and wore Newborn for 3 weeks before we moved to a size up. Your baby might be born bigger or grow up faster and outgrow his Newborn clothes even sooner than mine did. And I know parents who didnât purchase any Newborn clothes at all. Knowing all that, I would recommend getting some clothes in both sizes â Newborn and 0-3 months.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-7 order-lg-2">
          <p class="lead">To the second question â what items to get? With babyâs body so fragile and her head so soft you wonât be looking forward to changing her outfits. Itâs all about comfort and convenience here. Soft natural materials, no tight necks, as few buttons as possible. Youâll see that quite a few things fit this description, including kimonos and gowns, etc. My choice fell on a set of onesies and a set of footed sleep and playâs. Different brands name their items differently, so to explain myself â onesie is a t-shirt which clips under the diaper and sleep and play is a full body suit. Onesie serves as a first layer and can be the only layer during summer time, while sleep and play will go on top of it on a cooler day. Onesies can have short or long sleeves and different head opening designs. Choose onesies with wider head openings, youâll be grateful for those. Sleep and playâs come in cotton and fleece, as well as different styles. I prefer zippers over buttons/clips and footies over non-footed ones. Buttons look cute, but doing them in a right order is a pain. And with non-footed ones you might want socks, and socks easily get lost, so footies rock!</p>
          <p class="lead">Apart from onesies and sleep and plays, for the first six months of my babyâs life I barely used anything else, expect maybe for photo times. Obviously your decision will depend on temperatures in your area. For winter times you might want a jacket (with mittens attached, convenient!), a hat and soft fleece booties. For hot sunny days out there are hats with brims.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="lead">Okay, letâs say I persuaded you to buy onesies and sleep & play suits, but how many? The amount of clothes you need will depend on how messy things will turn out (which you donât know in advance!) and how often you prefer to do laundry. Onesies and sleep and play suits are often conveniently sold in sets. Get a set of five items each and you are covered for the beginning. If your baby will have a lot of blowouts or reflux, buying extra clothes is not a problem â ask someone to stop by the nearest Walmart or Fred Meyer, they sell baby stuff everywhere now. Otherwise, you might find yourself covered with just those few things. If you decided to follow my advice on getting both Newborn and 0-3 sizes, youâll need four sets total.</p>

          <p class="lead">Baby skin is sensitive which is why modern skin care industry has everything baby â baby wash and shampoo, baby oil, baby sunscreen, etc. Since we mentioned them, baby sunscreen (even though it has the word âbabyâ in it) should not be used until 6 months old, and baby oil is optional. Unless your baby has a very dry skin, thereâs no need to apply it. Baby wash and shampoo, on the other side, are pretty much a must. They often come in one bottle, similar to menâs body wash and shampoo. One of the leading brands in baby skin care is Aveeno, and I was very happy with their products not only for the little ones, but for us parents as well. They are gentle and very lightly-scented â exactly what we need.</p>

          <p class="lead">Sometimes baby bath towels come in a set with one or two washcloths (like the one I recommended above), but you definitely will need more than that. Washcloths are not only for the bath. They make a great cleaning tool whether itâs a baby face or a baby butt, or your new blouse. Very very handy. I kept them everywhere, including the diaper backpack and the car, etc.  How are baby washcloths different from regular washcloths? Well, they are supposed to be softer, and they are made of nice materials. For example, everyone is raving about bamboo. Interestingly enough, my favorite ones were the plain cheap ones with fairly low rating on Amazon, probably because they are very thin. But I liked them to be thin! I found it much easier to clean small creases on baby body with these, rather than thick bamboo ones.</p>

          <p class="lead">Crib is not only a place where your baby sleeps. It is also a safe place where you can leave the baby unattended knowing that she wonât roll over and fall (the danger becomes real at ~4 months of age). Therefore, definitely, get a crib! I am linking the one we ended up buying â and we are very happy with it! â but, honestly, I think the decision should come up to your furniture preferences. Cribs come in two sizes â standard and mini. You need a standard one which will fit a mattress of 28 x 52. Most cribs will feature adjustable mattress heights. Putting a baby down into a crib without waking her up is quite a task, so assemble the crib with your mattress on the highest setting â youâll be grateful for that!</p>
          <p class="lead"> Now, what you also need to know is that when your baby will start sleeping in the crib is a big question, and will depend on your thoughts around co-sleeping. Co-sleeping is considered unsafe and oh so not recommended by American Academy of Pediatrics, but many Moms end up going co-sleeping route anyways. Sleep training an infant is hard. Having to get up for a feeding 3-4 times/night is hard.</p>

          <p class="lead">The crib wonât work until you have a mattress and a sheet. Usually a mattress is not included with a crib for the same reason an adult mattress wonât come with a bed â there are tons of options and the price range is huge. The safety guidelines call for a firm mattress that fits snugly into the crib (to prevent suffocation risk), but less expensive mattresses meet these requirements all the same. I would also recommend a waterproof cover for the mattress, so that cleaning is never a problem. As for sheets, any fitted sheets should do â yes, there are so many cute designs! Depending on the baby you may find yourself changing sheets as rarely as once in 2 weeks, or as often as every day. But since you donât know how the routine will look like yet â 2 sheets and 2 waterproof covers would do for starters.</p>

          <p class="lead">You canât leave a baby with a blanket unsupervised because of a suffocation risk, and therefore no blankets go into a crib. By blanket I mean a loose blanket. You can swaddle a baby though and I would highly encourage all new parents to at least give it a try. Swaddling is not only a great way to keep your baby warm, but also a great technique to comfort him and help him fall asleep. Babies are not used to moving their arms and legs freely, there was not much room for exercise in their mamaâs belly. Being swaddled reminds them of the safe place and help them relax. If itâs a new concept to you, I highly recommend âThe Happiest Baby on the Blockâ â a famous book by Dr. Harvey Karp. It has some great information about why babies cry, along with practical advice of what to do about it.</p>
          <p class="lead">Back to blankets. Swaddling is a skill. If you wonât do it tight enough, the little one will loosen the fabric and wriggle his arms out, and thatâs exactly what kept happening to me. Even with all the diagrams and YouTube videos, I somehow still failed to get it right. And thatâs when I discovered swaddle blanket wraps. These come with self-fastening flaps that securely snuggle your baby in a safe swaddling sleep sack. You don't have to remember any swaddle techniques, and your baby won't be able to squirm out! A true lifesaver!</p>

Yes, some babies wonât let you keep them swaddled for the whole night and some wonât tolerate it at all.</p>

          <p class="lead">If youâve been researching baby stuff, you probably ran across at least a few articles advising against pacifiers. Typically these articles will emphasize that pacifiers might ruin your attempts to establish breastfeeding. The baby would prefer a pacifier over a breast or fail to develop a proper sucking technique. Personally, I thought this to be a valid point, so I waited ~3 weeks before introducing a pacifier. By that time our breastfeeding was at full speed, while my husband and I got so sleep-deprived, that we were ready to try anything to help our baby sleep longer stretches. It worked on several occasions, but overall our little one never developed a big love towards pacifiers. By the age of 6 months we got rid of them. Later I would meet parents of 2-3 year oldâs who would complain how they canât wean their kids from pacifiers. Being honest, it sort of made me feel good about ourselves. At the same time, remembering how little sleep we had, I know I would definitely try pacifiers again with my next baby.</p>
          <p class="lead">Pacifiers have sizes. That makes sense. Babies grow, so older babies will need bigger pacifiers. They also come in different shapes, which you just have to keep trying until you find the one. One of the most popular brands for newborn babies is Philips Avent.</p>

          <p class="lead">These three devices do different things. A rocker is similar to adult's rocking chair. You push it by either using your hands or simply nudging it with your toe to initiate the rocking motion. A bouncer is a seat on a wire frame that allows it to spring up and down. And a swing swings back and forth. Swings are powered mechanically and are larger than a bouncer or a rocker. In general, baby swings cost more too.</p>
          <p class="lead">They all, however, use the same idea of motion which babies like so much. This again goes back to their time in the womb where their world was constantly bouncing with mamaâs movement. Iâve heard of kiddos who would strongly prefer one type of device over another, but my baby didnât. We had both a bouncy seat and a swing, which worked great in a two story house! I mostly used them when my baby got sleepy during the day and needed a little help to drift off.</p>
          <p class="lead">All swings, bouncers and rockers have weight limits, but expect the magic to be over before your baby reaches it. Babies loose interest in them at around 6 months when they learn a new skill - crawling.</p>

          <p class="lead">Now many parents are not excited about the crib in the beginning, because it seems too big, too cold and too far away from their bed. There are all kinds of bassinets on the market, including so called bedside bassinets â those which are meant to be positioned right next to your bed for easy checking on the baby. The downside of any bassinet is that the baby will inevitably outgrow it in a next few months and will have to go back into the crib, so for me it felt like an unnecessary expense. I didnât have a bassinet. My friend â on the contrary â did and she loved it! Their bassinet was designed for bed sharing â they placed it right on their bed between Mom and Dad. She said the baby was much happier sleeping next to them and with the C-section it was a huge relief to be able to take care of him without having to get up.</p>

          <p class="lead">It makes sense that whether to get a breast pump or not should depend on your thoughts on breast feeding vs formula feeding. You might have your heart set up one way or the other, but â and this is a big but! â you donât know in advance how things will go. The beginning of my breast feeding was so painful and miserable, Iâd never guess I end up doing it for the whole year, while actively pumping at work for 9 months of it. My friend, on the other hand, was excited to start breast feeding, but her little guy refused to take the breast. The baby is one year old now and turned out just as healthy. My advice? Make no plans, get a breast pump and be ready for whatever happens. Recent research highlights so many benefits of breast feeding for both baby and mama, it seems logical to at least give it a try. And if it wonât work for some reason, then it wonât work, but at least you tried.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="lead">Now that might not make sense if youâre unfamiliar with breast feeding, but the breast pump is not just for those days when youâre away from your child. You will likely find yourself pumping to stimulate the supply in the very first days, and to express extra milk to prevent engorging, and to maybe even store some extra. All these are very good reasons to get a hold of your breast pump in advance, not after the little one comes out. Many health insurances cover breast pumps now, so check with your provider about your options. Mine recommended Medela, which was covered 100% and it did the job just fine. Now, there are many-many accessories for this pump â from cleaning supplies to breastshields of different sizes. These all seem to be important, but since you donât know how the breast feeding journey will turn out, hold off on buying any extra for now. The only thing which makes sense purchasing right away is a set of extra bottles, so that you donât have to wash the two that come with a pump after every pumping session. As for other accessories, after returning to work I bought a hands-free bra (this is a must!) and borrowed one of my husbandâs backpacks for carrying the pump around. Thatâs it!</p>

          <p class="lead">Most pumps come with two bottles which might seem enough for the beginning, but in reality washing them after every pumping session is a hustle. I had to purchase a set of 6 extra bottles almost right away and wish I did it earlier. Having extra bottles, you can use them not only for collecting milk, but also for a short-term storage and even for bottle-feeding â that is if you buy compatible nipples. About compatibility, before getting different brands always make sure that items you plan on buying will work with each other. Some things do, some donât.</p>

          <p class="lead">If you already have a Medela breast pump and bottles, the easiest way would be to also purchase their nipples. This way milk can get from breast to baby in one bottle. You might not need any bottles at all, if your breastfeeding will do wonders and the baby will stay with you for the whole time. But again, this is something you donât know, and we need to be prepared for all scenarios. If you wonât need bottles right away, you most likely will use them later.</p>
          <p class="lead">As for the choice of bottles, I got Dr Brown. My lactation consultant spoke very highly of them. In particular they recommended Dr Brownâs preemie nipples which have a slow flow and are considered closest to breast feeding. This way the baby will learn how to feed from both breast and bottle without developing a strong preference. As my lactation consultant explained, breast feeding babies need to work hard for their food and they might loose interest in it if you introduce a fast-flow nipple too soon. I started relying on bottles early on when I went back to work in 3 months, but I also wanted to continue breastfeeding which is why it was important to me not to sabotage it with bottles.</p>

          <p class="lead">Choosing a formula for your newborn is an important decision, and the more you plan on using formula, the more important it becomes. One of the safest, most nutritious and most difficult to get in the US is German brand Holle. If you will formula feeding exclusively, itâs a good idea to do your research and check what options are available to your family.</p>
          <p class="lead">If youâre set on breastfeeding, having some formula around will give you confidence that come what may, your little one wonât be left hungry. In this case you donât have to be picky. Enfamil and Similac are recommended by pediatricians and readily available in any grocery/department store. You donât even have to buy it. If you register on Enfamil or Similac web-sites, theyâll send you a free sample box, along with their coupons, etc.</p>
          <p class="lead">By the way, supplementing with formula is totally fine. Many moms will find itâs hard to maintain milk supply after returning to work. Supplementing ensures both healthy benefits of breastfeeding and having enough food to satisfy your babyâs hunger.</p>

          <p class="lead">A must-have to go with your purchase of bottles. There are plenty available, but I picked OXO because it includes a stand to ensure both your brush and your countertop will stay neat and dry. It also looked sturdier than some other brands.</p>

          <p class="lead">OXO also makes cute little dishwasher baskets for bottle parts and accessories which proved to be super useful. Without it youâre guaranteed spending tons of precious time searching for nipples and straws on the bottom of your dishwasher.  The doors of the basket hold up to 8 bottle nipples, which is a good amount. And you can always use it for bob baby-related items as well!</p>
